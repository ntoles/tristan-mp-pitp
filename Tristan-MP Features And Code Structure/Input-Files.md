**NEEDS UPDATING: VERY OUT OF DATE**

When `tristan-mp` is run, it looks for a file named `input` inside of the current directory. The `input` file contains all of the parameters we pass to the simulation.

## Input file structure

This page describes in detail what each keyword in the input file does, the possible values and the default values assumed by the code.

Below there is a sample input file for reference purposes. This input specifies a 2D simulation with 800 cells in the x direction, and 256 cells in the y direction. The simulation domain is decomposed in 16 blocks (CPU's / cores), along the y direction. The maximum number of particles supported is 6 x 10^7, and the physical problem being run is a Weibel instability simulation in external magnetic field. Strength of external field is set by
parameter sigma_ext. The velocity of light is 0.45 (simulation units), and the magnetization of the flow (sigma) is 0. The electron collisionless skin depth ( c / omega_pe) is 8, and the bulk flow velocity of the particles has a gamma of 100. Also, there are 10 simulation particles per cell in the box initially, the electron mass is set to 1, and the ion mass is set to 1. For a detailed description of each keyword in the input file check the Detailed Keyword Description section.

The input file is structured around named sections, which should stand on its own line, have a unique name, and be surrounded by <> (as in <node_configuration>). Any line starting with a # is a comment and is ignored by the input parser (any information after the # in a given line is ignored). Furthermore, any variables which are specified but not explicitly read in the code are just ignored, and if some keyword is omitted, a default value is usually assumed (which might lead to unexpected results). There are currently 10 sections that are currently being parsed: <node_configuration>, <time>, <grid>, <algorithm>, <restart>, <output>, <boundaries>, <domain>, <fields>, <particles>, and <problem>. Each section is concerned with a specific part of the algorithm, or with the control of some specific behavior of the code.
